# FreeCAD-.step

High quality parametrical 3D models electronic components, maded in [FreeCAD v0.18](https://freecadweb.org/index.php) by myself for export in .step format - for PCB layout design components use. 

Some useful things for KiCAD and [DipTrace](https://www.diptrace.com/rus/) schematic and PCB layout CADs users.Extension ".step" is for color 3D models for electronic components.

Use this stuff for easy make .step files different colors and parametrical amount of connectors - see HowTo's.

## How to to howto...

ALL howto's means what first of all you need:
- Download and setup FreeCAD.
- Open**.FCStd** file in it.
